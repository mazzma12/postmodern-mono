# postmodern-mono

This is an example repo of how to use a [uv Workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) effectively.

It's a companion to the blog post [Beyond Hypermodern: Python is easy now](https://rdrn.me/postmodern-python/).

And builds on the single-package repo example at [carderne/postmodern-python](https://github.com/carderne/postmodern-python).

## How to use this template
1. Hit the green `Use this template` button up on the right next to the stars
2. Give your new repository a name and then clone it to your dev environment.
3. Run around renaming stuff in the pyproject.toml files.
4. Run `uv sync --all-packages`
5. Have a look at the stuff below here, try out some commands and edit this README as you like!

## Development
Clone:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:carderne/postmodern-mono.git
```

Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for development:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Install Python and dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

Read on below...

## Structure
There are three packages split into libs and apps:
- **libs**: importable packages, never run independently, do not have entry points
- **apps**: have entry points, never imported

Note that neither of these definitions are enforced by anything in Python or `uv`.

```bash
> tree
.
├── pyproject.toml              # root pyproject
├── uv.lock
├── libs
│   └── greeter
│       ├── pyproject.toml      # package dependencies here
│       └── postmodern          # all packages are namespaced
│           └── greeter
│               └── __init__.py
└── apps
    ├── server
    │   ├── pyproject.toml      # this one depends on libs/greeter
    │   ├── Dockerfile          # and it gets a Dockerfile
    │   └── postmodern
    │       └── server
    │           └── __init__.py
    └── mycli
        ├── pyproject.toml      # this one has a cli entrypoint
        └── postmodern
            └── mycli
                └── __init__.py
```

## Docker
The server app includes a production-ready Dockerfile with multi-stage builds, security best practices, and optimized caching.

### Local Development
Build and run locally:
```bash
# Build the image
docker build --tag=postmodern-server -f apps/server/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run --rm -it postmodern-server

# Or use Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

## Syncing
To make life easier while you're working across the workspace, you should run:
```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

uv's sync behaviour is as follows:
- If you're in the workspace root and you run `uv sync`, it will sync only the
dependencies of the root workspace, which for this kind of monorepo should be bare.
This is not very useful.
- If you're in eg `apps/myserver` and run `uv sync`, it will sync only that package.
- You can run `uv sync --package=postmodern-server` to sync only that package.
- You can run `uv sync --all-packages` to sync all packages.

You can add an alias to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` if you like:
```bash
alias uvs="uv sync --all-packages"
```

## Dependencies
You'll notice that `apps/mycli` has `urllib3` as a dependency.
Because of this, _every_ package in the workspace is able to import `urllib3` **in local development**,
even though they don't include it as a direct or transitive dependency.

This can make it possible to import stuff and write passing tests, only to have stuff fail
in production, where presumably you've only got the necessary dependencies installed.

There are two ways to guard against this:

1. If you're working _only_ on eg `libs/server`, you can sync only that package (see above).
This will make your LSP shout and your tests fail, if you try to import something that isn't
available to that package.

2. Your CI (see example in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows)) should do the same.

## Dev dependencies
This repo has all the global dev dependencies (`pyright`, `pytest`, `ruff` etc) in the root
pyproject.toml, and then repeated again in each package _without_ their version specifiers.

It's annoying to have to duplicate them, but at least excluding the versions makes it easier
to keep things in sync.

The reason they have to be repeated, is that if you follow the example above and install only
a specific package, it won't include anything specified in the root package.

## Tasks/scripts
[Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) is used until uv includes its own task runner.

Tasks are defined in the root pyproject.toml, mostly running again `${PWD}` so that if
you run a task from within a package, it'll only run for that package.

You can run the tasks as follows:
```bash
uv run poe fmt
           lint
           check
           test

# or to run them all
uv run poe all
```

If you run any of these from the workspace root, it will run for all packages,
whereas if you run them inside a package, they'll run for only that package.

## Testing
This repo includes a simple pytest test for each package.

To test all packages:
```bash
uv sync --all-packages
uv run poe test
```

To test a single package:
```bash
cd apps/server
uv sync
uv run poe test
```

## Pyright
(This repo actually uses [basedpyright](https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/).

The following needs to be included with every package `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.pyright]
venvPath = "../.."       # point to the workspace root where the venv is
venv = ".venv"
strict = ["**/*.py"]
pythonVersion = "3.13"
```

Then you can run `uv run poe check` as for tests.
